# Introduction to MySQL and MySQL-Python Connectivity Module

Welcome to our Introduction to MySQL and MySQL-Python Connectivity module! In this module, we will cover the basics of working with MySQL databases and how to connect to them using Python.

Now, you might be wondering ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”</br>
   ### What is MySQL? </br>
   ### Why do we need to use MySQL??</br>

Well... to answer your questions,

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is widely used for storing and managing large amounts of data. It is a popular choice for web developers, data analysts, and businesses due to its flexibility, reliability, and scalability. MySQL was first released in 1995 and is now owned by Oracle Corporation.

MySQL is used for a wide range of applications, from small-scale web applications to large-scale enterprise systems. It is a powerful tool for storing and managing structured data, such as customer information, financial data, and product catalogs. MySQL is also commonly used for data analysis, with many data analytics tools offering built-in support for MySQL connectivity.

One of the main advantages of MySQL is its scalability. MySQL can handle large volumes of data and can easily be scaled up or down as needed. It also supports multiple storage engines, which allows for a high degree of flexibility in data management.

Another advantage of MySQL is its security features. MySQL includes built-in security features such as access control, encryption, and authentication, which help protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.

However, there are also some disadvantages to using MySQL. One of the main drawbacks is that it can be difficult to set up and configure for beginners. It also lacks some advanced features that are available in other databases, such as support for geospatial data and full-text search.

In summary, MySQL is a popular and widely used RDBMS that is valued for its flexibility, scalability, and security features. While it can be challenging to set up and configure, its advantages make it a popular choice for data management and analysis.


Here's why programmers tend to use Python and MySQL together
<ol>
         <li> Python and MySQL connectivity enables flexible and efficient data manipulation. </li>
         <li> Python's powerful data manipulation libraries like pandas and numpy make it easy to manipulate data in MySQL databases. </li>
         <li> Python and MySQL connectivity can automate database management tasks like database creation, table creation, and data import/export. </li>
         <li> Python's data analysis libraries like matplotlib and seaborn can be used to extract, transform, and analyze data in MySQL databases. </li>
         <li> Python web frameworks like Flask and Django provide built-in support for MySQL database connectivity for web development projects. </li>
         <li> Python is a cross-platform language, and MySQL is compatible with multiple operating systems, making it possible to create cross-platform database applications. </li>
        </ol>
         
         
We hope you'll find this module both informative and enjoyable. Let's get started on our journey to mastering MySQL and Python connectivity!

### Tasks

1. Create a database and add your family's info to it.<br>
                
             
2. Create a menu driven program with user defined functions and MySQL commands to simulate a Library Register. 
  You can use functions like ADD, UPDATE, DELETE etc to simulate adding / returning a book, updating stock or renewing a book etc. 
  The database must contain atleast the Title, Author, Return date and any other details you wish to add

                
3. Building a simple shopping cart
 <ul>
         <li> Create a database table to store products with their name, price, and description.</li>
         <li> Allow the user to browse the products and add items to their cart.</li>
         <li> Store the contents of the cart in the database and display the total price.</li> 
         <li> Allow the user to checkout and complete their purchase.</li> 
</ul>
