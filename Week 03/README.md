# Working with Files


Welcome to our Introduction to MySQL and MySQL-Python Connectivity module! In this module, we will cover the basics of working with MySQL databases and how to connect to them using Python.

To start off let's clear up some doubts shall we?

## What are Files ?
Files are a type of data storage that allow information to be saved and retrieved on a computer. They can contain any type of information, such as text, images, or program code. Files are used for a wide range of applications, from storing important documents to managing data for software applications.

Python is a programming language that is often used for data processing and analysis. One of the main advantages of Python is its ability to work with files. Python provides a wide range of file-handling functions and modules that allow developers to read, write, and manipulate files. This makes Python a powerful tool for managing and processing data stored in files.

## Why use Files
One of the key advantages of using files with Python is the ability to store and process large amounts of data. Python can handle large files without running out of memory or causing performance issues. Additionally, Python's file handling functions allow developers to easily organize and manipulate data within files.

Another advantage of using files with Python is the ability to automate repetitive tasks. Python can be used to write scripts that automate tasks such as file conversion, data extraction, and data cleaning. This can save time and reduce the risk of errors in data management tasks.

However, there are also some disadvantages to using files. One of the main drawbacks is the risk of data loss or corruption. If a file is not properly backed up or managed, it can become corrupted or lost, which can cause significant problems for data management. Additionally, some file formats may not be compatible with Python, which can limit the types of files that can be processed.

### Tasks

1. Create a text file and add your personal info to it.<br>
                
             
2. Create a menu driven program with user defined functions to create a new file, copy contents from file to another and display a file.

                
3. Write a program that stores numbers entered by the user into a file. Then once the user stops, another function must sort through the file and create a new file which separates the numbers into 3 groups, even, odd and prime. U may also add another classification to make the task more fun
                Example<br>                
                ```  Input File  1 12 10 8 3 16 2 4 5 0           ```               
                ```  Output File Even :  12 10 8 16 2 4 0
                                 Odd : 1 3 5 
                                 Prime : 3 2 5                    ```<br>
