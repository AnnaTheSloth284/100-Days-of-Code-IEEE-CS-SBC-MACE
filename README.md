# 100 Days of Code | IEEE CS SBC MACE x IEEE RAS SBC MACE

## Welcome to 100 Days of Code everyone !
Here our aim is to promote the practice of DIY Learning. Upskill yourself in various aspects of programming 
and coding languages by building projects with like minded peers under mentors in just 100 days.

  <summary><h3>Thing you need to know before getting started</h3></summary> 
  <ul>
    <li>The groups were created since we'd be having 👥some group tasks too in the coming weeks. And dont worry😟, we split the groups based on your responses✍️</li>
    <li>Each group will have a mentor 👩‍🏫👨‍🏫who would be keeping track of your progress 📈on almost a daily basis</li> 
    <li>So since we are having quite a diverse audience🌐, it isn't necessary that everyone can keep up with the same pace💨. So if you are getting stuck anywhere, 💬do inform your group mentors or us of the same and we'd be more than happy to help 🤗</li>
    <li>We won't be able to guarantee it a 24x7 ⏱️service , but we have a great mentor team🫂 to help you get you doubts cleared💭</li> 
    <li>If you need us to sit with you in helping you understand a particular concept 📚or something, we'll be available for both online meets💻, or calls, or after class hours 🏛️ on weekdays @ the IEEE Lab🔬(do inform us earlier tho). We are always there to help you out. </li> 
    <li>Except for weekends (you will need special permission), you are free to use 🌝 the IEEE lab learning or doing the tasks after class hours 👩‍🎓👨‍🎓from 4:00-5:30pm given that you inform us📞 earlier.</li>
